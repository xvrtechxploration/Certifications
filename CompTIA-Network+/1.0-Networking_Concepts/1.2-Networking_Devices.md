# **Networking Devices**
> _Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions._

## Physical & Virtual Appliances
- Physical appliances are dedicated hardware devices focused on specific network functions, offering high performance and reliability but at a higher cost and with space requirements.
- Virtual appliances are software-based solutions that run on virtual machines, providing similar functionalities with greater flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, but potentially at the expense of raw performance.
### Router
- OSI layer 3 device (Network)
- Directs data packets between different networks based on IP addresses.
_ Use routing tables to determine best path for packet forwarding.
- Routers inside of switches sometimes called "Layer 3 switches"
    - Layer 2 = Switch
    - Layer 3 = Router
- Routes traffic between IP subnets
    - May be withing a data center of other parts of the world
- Often connects diverse network types
    - LAN to WAN, etc.
    - Copper to fiber, etc.
### Switch
- Bridging done in hardware by MAC address
    - Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
        - Hardware inside devices
- Functions in OSI layer 2
    - Forwards traffic based on data link address (MAC)
- Many ports and features for different functions and capabilities
    - Core of enterprise network
    - May provide PoE
- Multilayer switch 
    - Includes routing (layer 3) function
### Firewall
- Traditional firewalls filter traffic by port number or application
- Modern Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) identify applications traversing network and mange (allow/deny)
- May be able to encrypt traffic
    - VPN
- Most firewalls can be layer 3 devices
    - Sit at ingress/egress of network
    - Manages traffic between inside and outside of network
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Dynamic Routing 
### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
### Load Balancer
### Proxy
### Network-attached Storage (NAS)
### Storage area network (SAN)
### Wireless
#### Access Point (AP)
#### Controller

## Applications
### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

## Functions
### Virtual Private Network (VPN)
### Quality of Service (QoS)
### Time to Live (TTL)
