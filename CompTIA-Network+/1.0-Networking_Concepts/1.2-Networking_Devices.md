# **Networking Devices**
> _Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions._

## Physical & Virtual Appliances
- Physical appliances are dedicated hardware devices focused on specific network functions, offering high performance and reliability but at a higher cost and with space requirements.
- Virtual appliances are software-based solutions that run on virtual machines, providing similar functionalities with greater flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, but potentially at the expense of raw performance.
### Router
- OSI layer 3 device (Network)
- Directs data packets between different networks based on IP addresses.
_ Use routing tables to determine best path for packet forwarding.
- Routers inside of switches sometimes called "Layer 3 switches"
    - Layer 2 = Switch
    - Layer 3 = Router
- Routes traffic between IP subnets
    - May be withing a data center of other parts of the world
- Often connects diverse network types
    - LAN to WAN, etc.
    - Copper to fiber, etc.
### Switch
- Bridging done in hardware by MAC address
    - Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
        - Hardware inside devices
- Functions in OSI layer 2
    - Forwards traffic based on data link address (MAC)
- Many ports and features for different functions and capabilities
    - Core of enterprise network
    - May provide PoE
- Multilayer switch 
    - Includes routing (layer 3) function
### Firewall
- Traditional firewalls filter traffic by port number or application
- Modern Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) identify applications traversing network and mange (allow/deny)
- May be able to encrypt traffic
    - VPN
- Most firewalls can be layer 3 devices
    - Sit at ingress/egress of network
    - Manages traffic between inside and outside of network
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Dynamic Routing 
### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
- Devices that monitors network and/or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations.
- Intrusion Detections System (IDS)
    - Passively monitors and alerts system administrators of suspicious activity or inbound attacks
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
    - Actively blocks or prevents activities based on detected anomalies, signatures, and policies to protect network from threats.
    - Stops attack before it gets inside the network.
- Intrusions
    - Usually known attack types
    - Exploits against operating systems, applications, etc.
    - Buffer overflows, cross-site scripting, other vulnerabilities.
### Load Balancer
- Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, improving the reliability and availability of applications.
- Makes decisions based on IP addresses, TCP/UDP ports, or application-level content to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response times, and avoid overload of any single resource.
- Provides fault tolerance
- Configurable loads
- TCP offload
- SSL offload
- Caching
- Prioritization
    - QoS
- Content switching
    - Application-centric balancing.
### Proxy
- A proxy acts as an intermediary between a user device and the internet, receiving request from clients, forwarding them to the relevant server, and returning the server's response to the client.
- Can provide additional functionality such as content caching, access control, and filtering.
    - Enhances security and performance.
### Network-attached Storage (NAS)
- Dedicated file storage device connected to a network
    - Allows multiple users and client devices to retrieve and store data from a centralized location.
- Designed for easy file sharing, data backups, and centralized data management.
- Supports variety of protocols such as NFS, SMB/CIFS, and AFP.
- Offer scalable and cost-effective solutions.
- Requires a lot of bandwidth
