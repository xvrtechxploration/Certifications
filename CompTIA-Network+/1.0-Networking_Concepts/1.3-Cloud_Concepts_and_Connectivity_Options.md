# Cloud Concepts & Connectivity Options 
> _Summarize cloud concepts and connectivity options._

## Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)
- NFV involves the decoupling of network functions from hardware devices and running them as software instances on virtual machines or containers.
    - Replace physical devices with virtual ones.
- Manage rom the hypervisor
- Allows for flexible deployment and management of networking services like firewalls, load balancers, and intrusion detection systems.
- Reduces need for dedicated hardware and enables dynamic scaling and management.
    - Enhance resources utilization and reduce costs.
- Quickly and easily deploy network functions with the click of a button.
## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Isolated network space within a public cloud designed to provide a similar level of segmentation, control, and security as a private data center.
- Users can define their own IP address range, configure subnets, route tables, and network gateways.
- Allows enterprises to run their cloud resources in a virtual network that they can control/manage as it were their own data center.
- A pool of resources created in a public cloud.
- It is common to create many separate VPCs for different application instances or different parts of a company.
    - Keep them separated but manage them as individual virtual appliances.
## Network Security Groups
- Used to control inbound and outbound traffic to cloud resources within a VPC
- Act as a virtual firewall for associated instances to control traffic based on rules that specify port rules, protocols, and source/destination IP addresses.
- Implement security level at protocol and port access level, ensuring only legitimate traffic reaches cloud resources.
- Assigns the security rule to an entire IP subnet.
    - Can be difficult to manage because not all devices have the same security needs.
## Network Security Lists
- Also used for managing and securing network traffic in a cloud environment.
- More options for assigning rules.
    - Provide stateful or stateless traffic filtering on a subnet level.
    - Enable more granular control over traffic between subnets withing the same VPC or across different VPCs
    - Assign a security rule to a specific virtual NIC (VNIC) 
    - Place devices in a group for more control and specific rules for smaller groups of devices.
- 
## Cloud Gateways
- Serve as intermediary devices or services that connect cloud environments with different networks, including private data centers or other cloud services.
- Facilitate communication, data transfer, and management between these different environments.
- Connects users on the internet.
### Internet Gateway
- Serves as a bridge between a VPC and the internet.
- Enables internet access for the resources within the VPC
- Facilitates communication between instances in the cloud and external networks.
### Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway
- Allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other external resources while preventing external connections with these instances or seeing their private IP address.
    - Use a public IP address of gateway and hide private address behind it.
- Crucial for instances that require outbound internet access but do not need inbound internet connections.
## Cloud Connectivity Options
### VPN
- Site-to-site VPN through the internet
- Allows users to connect from a remote site of workstation.
- Creates safe and encrypted connection to cloud resources.
### Direct Connect
- Private-direct connections are dedicated network links between an organization's on-premise infrastructure and a cloud service provider's data-center.
- Bypasses the public internet, offering more reliable, secure, and faster connectivity for accessing cloud services.
- Ideal for businesses with stringent performance and security requirements for their cloud-based applications and data.
## Deployment Models
### Public
- Provides services over the internet to multiple customers or the general public, where infrastructure and resources are owned and operated by the service provider.
- Offers scalability and flexibility, reducing the need for organizations to invest and maintain their own infrastructure.
### Private
- A private deployment model is dedicated to a single organization and can be hosted on-premise or by a third-party provider.
- Offers greater control and security over resources and private models. 
    - Suitable for businesses with strict regulatory compliance or unique business needs.
- Virtualized local data center.
### Hybrid
- Combines public and private models, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
- Provides businesses with flexibility, scalability, and security by enabling them to keep sensitive data private while leveraging public cloud resources for non-sensitive operations.
## Service Models
### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Delivers applications over the internet, accessible through a web browser, eliminating the need for installations and maintenance on individual devices.
- Allows users to access software applications on a subscription basis, providing convenience and cost savings on software licensing and infrastructure.
- Someone else manages, creates applications, etc.
- Can raise security concerns.
    - Data stored on third-party platform
- Examples
    - Google Mail, Office 365
    - Complete application offerings.
### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, offering a fully outsourced service for computing infrastructure.
- "hardware as a service"
- Users can rent servers, storage space, and networking capabilities, scaling resources up or down based on demand.
    - Ideal for flexibility and scalability without the cost of physical hardware.
- Still responsible for management
    - Installation, data, security, upgrading, etc.
- Data is out there on 3rd party hardware but more withing your control.
- Examples
    - Web server providers
    - Buy time on a web server.
### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Offers cloud platform and tools to allow developers to build, test, deploy and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
- Provides a development environment, application hosting, and a deployment platform.
    - Streamline the development process and reduce the complexity of managing hardware and software layers.
- No direct control of the data, people, or infrastructure 
    - Trained security professionals are watching your stuff.
        - Choose provider carefully.
- Example
    - Salesforce
    - Custom application running on a platform.
## Scalability
- The capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
- Not just the ability to increase resources but to do so easily and cost-effectively
## Elasticity
- Ability to automatically scale computing resources up or down as needed.
- Ensures applications always have the right amount of resources to meet demand without manual intervention.
- Crucial for handling varying workloads.
- Fundamental characteristic of cloud services.
## Multitenancy
- Software architecture principle where a single instance of software serves multiple tenants/user.
- Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.
- Cost effective way for providers to manage a single application across various users.
- Resources and costs can be shared efficiently.
