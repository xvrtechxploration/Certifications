### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

- Connectionless protocol
- Allows transmission of data without establishing a prior connection between sender and receiver.

	- Tunnel
		- Encrypts both the header and payload
		- used for VPN connections 

#### Authentication Header (AH)

- Component of IPSec used for providing connectionless integrity and data origin authentication of IP packets.
- Protection against replay attacks.

#### Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

- Provides:
	- Confidentiality
	- Data-origin authentication
	- Connectionless integrity
	- Anti-replay service
	- Limited traffic-flow confidentiality
	- AH provides authentication and integrity, ESP adds encryption to ensure confidentiality of data.

#### Internet Key Exchange (IKE)

- Set up a secure, authenticated communication channel between two parties.
- Used in VPN environments to establish security associations (SAs) that provide the necessary encryption and authentication.
- Two phases:
	- Phase 1
		- Establishes the identity of communication parties and sets up a secure channel for further negotiations.
- Phase 2
		- Negotiates the SA parameters to be used to encrypt data
		- Uses a combination of key exchange mechanisms, encryption algorithms, and digital signatures or certificates to ensure that the communications are secure and verified.

### Traffic Types

#### Unicast

- One-to-one form of communication
- Data is sent from one source to one specific destination identified by a unique IP address.
- Most common form of IP communication.
- Used for most internet traffic (web browsing, email, and file transfers.)
- Ensures that data packets are delivered to a single, specific recipient over a network.

#### Multicast

- Data is sent from one or more sources to multiple destinations simultaneously over a network, using a specific multicast group address.
- Efficient for applications like streaming video or audio, where the same data needs to be delivered to multiple recipients, reducing bandwidth consumption vs. sending separate copies to each recipient.
- Optimized delivery of packets to multiple destinations.

#### Anycast
- Data is sent to the nearest or best destination as determined by routing protocols.
- it is used in IPv6 (less in IPv4) to provide fast and efficient delivery of services by directing users to the closest server. 
- Common in DNS and CDN (Content Delivery Network) services.
- Can improve network performance and availability by automatically routing requests to the nearest data center.

#### Broadcast
- Message is sent from one sender to all potential receivers withing a network segment.
- In IPv4, broadcast address is used to send data to all devices on a LAN simultaneously, such as when a device requests an IP address via DHCP.
- Not supported in IPv6, instead multicast addresses are used for similar purposes.
