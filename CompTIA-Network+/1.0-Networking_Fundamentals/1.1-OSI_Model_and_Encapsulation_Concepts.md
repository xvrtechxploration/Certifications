# **OSI Model and Encapsulation Concepts**
> *_Compare and contrast the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and encapsulation concepts_*

## OSI Model
### The OSI Model
- A way to describe the way traffic moves from one part of the network to another
- Unique protocols at each layer
- A guide that provides common language for communication within IT

#### Layer 1 - Physical
- The physical parts of the network.
    - Signaling, cables, and connectors
- Physical transmission of data bits over a communication chennel.
- Defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects of transmitting raw data between network devices.
- Converting digital data into a format suitable for transmission and ensuring reliable and efficient communication at the physical level
- Possible problems:
    - Test/replace cabling, run loopback tests, swap adapter cards, punch-downs, etc.

#### Layer 2 - Data Link
- The basic network "language"
    - The foundation of communication is at the data link layer
- Node-to-node delivery of data
    - Moving frame from one hop the the next
- Also responsible for encoding, decoding, and organizing outgoing/incoming data
- Data Link Control (DLC) Protocols
    - Media Access Control (MAC) on Ethernet
        - "Layer two addresses"
        - Communication using **MAC addresses**
            - Sometimes referred to as the switching layer
- Devices
    - Switch, Bridge, Network Adapter

#### Layer 3 - Network
- The "routing" layer
    - Chooses best path to transmit data 
- Communication using Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
- Transmission in form of packets via various logical network pathways/routes
- Maintain the quality of the data and pass and transmit it from its source to its destination
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Fragment frames to traverse different networks
    - Broken into smaller pieces to move across the network

#### Layer 4 - Transport
- The "Post Office" layer
    - How and where the data is being delivered
- TCP and UDP protocols
- When data is too large and needs to be sent in individual pieces and put back together at the destination

#### Layer 5 - Session
- Communication management between devices
    - When data transfers start, stop, or need to restart
- Uses control and tunneling protocols
- Set up sessions to begin transferring data

#### Layer 6 - Presentation
- Takes the data and puts it in a form we understand/Human readable
- Character encoding and application encryption
- Data format translation
- Data compression
- Often combined with the Application layer

#### Layer 7 - Application
- The layer we see and interact with
- HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3, etc.

        - Transmission modes
            - Describes the ways in which data is transmitted
            - simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex
    - Cables, fiber, connectors, power plugs, receivers
        - Hubs, ethernet, 802.11
    - Electrical signals
        - Unstructured raw data streams over a physical medium
- Layer 2 - Data Link
    - Sub-layers 
        - Logical Link Control (LLC)
            - deals with multiplexing, the flow of data among applications and other service, and providing error messages and acknowledgments
        - Media Access Control (MAC)
            - Manages the device's interaction
            - Responsible for addressing frames
            - Controls physical media access
    - Functions
        - Framing
            - Packet received from the the network layer is known as a frame in the data link layer
            - DLL receives packets from network layer and divides them into small frames, then sends each frame bit-by-bit to the physical layer or vise-versa
            - Attaches special bit (for error control and addressing) at the header and end of the frame
        - Addressing 
            - Encapsulates the source and destination's MAC/physical address in the header of each frame to ensure node-to-node delivery
        - Error Control
            - Detect errors in transmitted data and correct it using error detection and correction techniques
            - Adds error detection bits into header so receiver can check if data is correct or not.
        - Flow Control
            - Synchronize sender and receiver speeds to establish flow control and prevent overflow 
        - Access Control
            - Check which device has control over channel
            - Help to avoid collisions and loss of frames
    - Protocols (add notes later)
    - Frames, MAC addresses, Extended Unique Identifies (EUI-48, EUI-64), Switch, Ethernet
- Layer 3 - Network
    - Functions
        - Assigning Logical Addresses
            - Assign logical addresses to devices sending or receiving data packets
            - Data packets consist of IP address of both sender/receiver
                - Divided into host and network ID
            - Used to confirm packets were sent by authorized sender and successfully reached desired receiver
        - Routing
            - Identifying best path to transmit packets.
            - Numerous routers used to find best and safest route to transmit.
            - Uses routing algorithms (link state, Distance Vector, Flooding, Random Walk, etc.)
            - Header of each packet holds information regarding the path they need to follow to reach destination.
        - Host-to-Host delivery
            - Also known as forwarding
            - Process in which the network layer transmits or forwards the data packets via routers, after determining the best path/route
        - Logical Subnetting
            - Allows bigger network to be divided into smaller chucks of network
            - Helps IP address to be used more efficiently.
            - Manage larger networks more efficiently.
        - Fragmentation and Reassembly 
            - Each device/node has maximum capacity to receive data, which is called Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
            - If total size of data packets exceeds the limit, packets must be fragmented into more smaller packets.
            - At receiving end, all fragments must be rearranged to create the actual data in order.
            - Done by routers
        - Error Handling
            - Checks for errors and handles them.
                - Techniques like Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and Checksums.
            - Retransmits packets with are erroneous or didn't reach the receiver.
            - Uses the ACK messages to determine whether a packet has been successfully received.
        - Quality of Service (QoS)
            - Keeps track of important data or particular quality of data which is needed to be sent first.
            - Prioritize data types
        - Network Address Translation (NAT)
            - Converts private IP address into a public Ip address
            - Used when sending data across separate networks.
        - Congestion Control
            - If there is an excessive load on the network, network becomes congested and data transmission is paused.
            - Dealt with using different algorithms.
        - Encapsulation and Decapsulation
            - Encapsulates data from transport layer and adds important header parts to the packets.
            - After receiving data packets on the destination side, decapsulates and makes them original size.
